We're excited to announce a powerful new feature that gives you better control over your track sharing: **Share Link Management**.

## What's New

Managing who has access to your tracks just got a whole lot easier. Here's what you can now do:

### Manage All Your Share Links

View all your active share links in one organized place. Our new interface displays a clean table showing creation dates, expiration times, and permissions for each link you've created.

### Name Your Shares

Add custom names to your share links to help you remember who you shared with or what the link is for. Examples might include "Client Demo", "Blog Post", or "John Smith" - whatever helps you stay organized.

### Track Usage

See when each share link was last accessed. This gives you valuable insight into engagement and helps you understand which shares are being used.

### Quick Deletion

Revoke access instantly by removing share links with a single click. No more worrying about old links floating around - you can clean them up whenever needed.

### Easy Navigation

Browse through all your shares with pagination support, even if you have many active links.

## How to Access

Getting to the Share Management interface is simple - just click **"Manage Tokens"** when creating a share link.

This feature is part of our ongoing effort to give you more control and transparency over your shared content. We hope it makes managing your track sharing simpler and more efficient!
