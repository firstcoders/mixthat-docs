## How We Secure Your Audio Assets

At Mix That, the security of your audio files and personal data is a top priority. We use industry-standard encryption for data at rest and in transit, robust authentication, and strict access controls to ensure your content is protected at every stage.

- **Encryption:** All audio assets are encrypted both during upload/download and while stored on our servers.
- **Access Controls:** Only authorized users can access your private tracks. Public tracks are only accessible via their unique URLs.
- **Monitoring:** We continuously monitor our systems for suspicious activity and regularly update our security protocols.

A detailed technical description of our security architecture will be published soon.

For [Enterprise Sponsors](/docs/reference/sponsor-this-project/), we can provide source code access for independent security audits and compliance reviews.

If you have questions about our security practices or need more information, please [contact us](/contact).
