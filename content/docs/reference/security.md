## How We Secure Your Audio Assets

At Mix That, the security of your audio files and personal data is a top priority. We use industry-standard encryption for data at rest and in transit, robust authentication, and strict access controls to ensure your content is protected at every stage.

## Enterprise-Grade Security Experience

Mix That is developed by [Firstcoders](https://www.firstcoders.co.uk), a software consultancy with decades of experience building enterprise software solutions for some of the world's largest music companies. This extensive background in the music industry has given us deep insights into the unique security challenges and requirements for audio content protection.

Our team has applied this enterprise-level expertise to Mix That's security architecture, ensuring that your audio assets benefit from the same rigorous security standards we've implemented for major industry players. We understand the critical importance of protecting creative content and have designed our systems with the music industry's best practices in mind.

## Authentication & Account Security

Mix That uses a robust, cloud-based authentication service that provides secure user account management and authentication. This system handles user registration, login, password management, and session security with industry-standard protocols.

Key authentication features include:

- **Secure Password Requirements:** Strong password policies to protect your account
- **Encrypted Session Management:** All user sessions are encrypted and securely managed
- **Password Reset Security:** Secure password recovery processes via email verification
- **Account Verification:** Email-based account verification for new registrations

**Note:** Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not currently enabled but may be added in future updates to further enhance account security. Let us know if this is something you desire!

## Asset Protection

- **Access Controls:** Only authorized users can access your private tracks. Public tracks are only accessible via their unique URLs.
- **Secure Asset Delivery:** We protect your audio files using CloudFront signed URLs combined with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication. All encryption keys use a minimum of 256-bit encryption to ensure robust security for asset access.
- **Monitoring:** We continuously monitor our systems for suspicious activity and regularly update our security protocols.

For [Enterprise Sponsors](/docs/other/sponsor-this-project/), we can provide source code access for independent security audits and compliance reviews.
