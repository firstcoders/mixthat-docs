To keep costs in check we have to impose certain limitations with respect to storage & network traffic. Sorry!

## Limits for free accounts

- Storage is limited to 2GB per account or 25 tracks;
- Up to 5000 requests per month;
- Tracks that have not received _any_ requests for a significant amount of time (more than 3 months) may be deleted without warning;
- Audio quality is set to `64k Opus`, which is roughly comparable to `128k MP3`;

## Sponsors

If you require additional storage, we hope you'd consider becoming a [sponsor](/docs/reference/sponsor-this-project/).

As [premium sponsors](/docs/reference/sponsor-this-project/) can get access to

- [The API](/docs/guides/api/);
- You can store Download Quality Audio so that you can [download mixes](/docs/quickstart/downloading-a-mix/);

In addition we are happy to discuss upgrading,

- Storage & Traffic limits;
- Audio Quality;

## Monitoring

CAUTION: Please note that we will actively monitor accounts in order to prevent creative ways designed to circumvent the limits above and may disable or block any accounts that we deem suspicious.
