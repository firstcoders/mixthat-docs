What's New with Mix That?
The previous beta version of Mix That is still available at [https://beta.mixthat.co](https://beta.mixthat.co) and will remain accessible until the end of the year. Please note that uploading new audio will be disabled on the beta version soon.

We've been busy making exciting improvements to Mix That, and we're thrilled to share what's new!

# Key Improvements

- Enhanced Audio Storage & Streaming: We've significantly improved our audio storage capabilities, allowing you to store more audio and enjoy faster streaming speeds.
- Player Enhancements: The Mix That player now includes a fantastic new feature: you can select regions to loop, perfect for honing in on specific parts of your tracks. Plus, you can now easily download your mixes directly from the player.
- Detailed Waveform View: Get a closer look at your audio with our new zoom-in functionality, letting you examine the waveform in greater detail.
- Modern REST API: For developers and power users, we've introduced a robust REST API, opening up new possibilities for integration and automation.
- Overhauled Upload Process: We've completely redesigned the upload experience to be more intuitive and user-friendly. You can now interact with the player while you add your audio, making the process seamless.
