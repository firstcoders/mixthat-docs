The (previous) beta version of Mix That can be found at [https://beta.mixthat.co](https://beta.mixthat.co), and will remain accessible until at least summer 2025.

## What's different?

- We have made improvements to audio storage size, enabling storing more audio and improving streaming speeds;
- We have added a feature to the player to allow selection of regions as well as zooming;
- The page listing public tracks is no longer supported (sorry);
- We have added a modern [REST API](/docs/guides/api/) enabling integration with backends [Premium Sponsors Only](/docs/reference/sponsor-this-project/)
- We have overhauled the upload process, making it more friendly and allowing you to interact with the player as you add audio.
