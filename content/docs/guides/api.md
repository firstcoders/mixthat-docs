We have created a REST-full API which will allow you to integrate your backend with mixthat, enabling you to delegate the complicated bits that deal with transcoding, hosting and serving of your stem-audio to Mix That.

The API can be made available for [premium sponsors](/docs/reference/sponsor-this-project/), please [contact us](/contact) for help.

API documentation can be found [here](/openapi).
