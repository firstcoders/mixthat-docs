Uploading Your Stems
Ready to upload your audio and create a new track? It's simple!

First, register for an account. Once you're signed in, head over to the [Upload page](https://app.mixthat.co/upload).

On this page, you can create a new track and add your audio stems. Just drag and drop your files directly onto the page, or click the add files button to select them.

Track Settings
After uploading, you can fine-tune your track's details.

Select the controls-bar and click edit to access the general settings. Here, you can:

- Add a label (track title)
- Write a description
- Add tags to help with discovery

Public Access & Quality
You can also make your track publicly accessible. This means anyone with the track's URL can play it without needing to log in.

Below the settings, you'll see an indicator for the audio quality stored for your track. This will show if the audio is streaming only or if it's available for both streaming and download quality.

Managing Your Stems
Easily organize your individual stems within the track:

- Rename a Stem: Select the stem you want to change, then click the edit button to update its label.
- Reorder Stems: Use the ▲ (up) and ▼ (down) buttons to move a selected stem up or down in the list.
- Remove a Stem: If you need to take a stem out, select it and click the remove button.

Saving Your Work
Once you're happy with how your player is set up and your stems are organized, simply hit save. Your track will then be saved to your account, ready to be shared or further developed!

## Important Notes About Uploading

- **Audio Duration Limits:** Each stem you upload must be under a maximum duration, which depends on your account type. If a file is too long, you'll see a clear error message and may need to upgrade your account for longer uploads.
- **Audio Quality & Source Options:** You may see options for streaming-only or downloadable (source) audio. Audio quality can be set to **LOW (64kbps Opus)** or **HIGH (96kbps Opus)**—Opus is a modern, highly efficient codec that delivers excellent sound quality even at lower bitrates. Some options may be disabled if your account does not have permission for high quality or source downloads.
- **Track & Stem Limits:** There are limits on the number of tracks you can create and the number of stems per track. If you reach a limit, you'll be notified and may need to upgrade your account or remove existing tracks/stems.
- **Permissions:** Some upload features (like high quality, long duration, or source downloads) require an upgraded account. If you don't have access, you'll see a warning or error message.
