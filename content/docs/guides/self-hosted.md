If you are an [enterprise sponsor](/docs/reference/sponsor-this-project/) and are interested in hosting Mix That in your own environment then that is possible.

Mix That is built using only modern technology and methods, using a "serverless-first" approach which ensures a very cost-effictive and scalable way to host the application.

A self hosted Mix That instance can be used, for example, as a "track-microservice" in which you host your audio assets. Mix That can then take care of transcoding of the audio into streams which you can use to play audio on your own platform.

In due course we will make the source code available. We will also publish detailed documentation and architectural diagrams which will help your developers to understand the stack.

Please [contact us](/contact) if you like any more information.
