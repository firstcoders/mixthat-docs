If you are an [enterprise sponsor](/docs/reference/sponsor-this-project/) interested in hosting Mix That within your own infrastructure, we offer a flexible self-hosting option.

Mix That is architected with a modern, serverless-first approach, ensuring cost-effectiveness, scalability, and ease of deployment. This makes it ideal for organizations seeking control over their audio assets and data.

A self-hosted Mix That instance can serve as a dedicated "track microservice," allowing you to manage, store, and transcode audio assets for seamless integration with your own platforms. Our solution handles audio transcoding and streaming, so you can focus on delivering a great user experience.

We are preparing to release the source code, along with comprehensive documentation and architectural diagrams to support your development team in deploying and maintaining your instance.

For more information or to discuss your requirements, please [contact us](/contact). We are happy to provide guidance and early access to resources as they become available.
