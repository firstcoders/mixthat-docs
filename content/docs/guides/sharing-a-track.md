## Sharing Options by Account Type

### Free Accounts

- **Private Tracks:** A secure, time-limited URL will be generated that **expires after 3 days**. This temporary link is perfect for quick sharing with collaborators or friends.
- **Public Tracks:** A public URL will be generated that remains valid as long as the track is public, allowing anyone with the link to listen without logging in.

### Sponsored Accounts

- **Private Tracks:** You can choose your preferred expiry period for sharing URLs, or create **permanent links that never expire** for long-term sharing and embedding.
- **Public Tracks:** Same as free accounts - public URLs remain valid as long as the track is public.

## Account Features

- You can change a track's public/private status at any time in the track settings
- Remember, sharing a public link means anyone with the URL can access your track
- [Become a sponsor](/docs/general/sponsor-this-project/) to unlock extended or permanent sharing options

Enjoy sharing your music, and let us know if you have any questions or need help with sharing options!
