You can share a track by clicking on the share icon.

![share icon](./icon-share.png "share icon")

For tracks that are not marked as [public](/docs/quickstart/upload-audio/#player-settings) a secure URL will be generated. This URL will provide access to the track for 30 days.

For tracks that are marked as [public](/docs/quickstart/upload-audio/#player-settings) a URL will be generated that will remain valid until the track is no longer marked as public.
