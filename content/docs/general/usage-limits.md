## Keeping Mix That Sustainable

To offer Mix That as a free service, we need to manage our operational costs, particularly for storage and network traffic. We've implemented some fair usage limits to ensure everyone can enjoy the platform.

## Free Account Limits

Here's what you can expect with a free Mix That account:

- **Storage**: You can store up to 2GB of audio or a maximum of 25 tracks, whichever limit is reached first.
- **Network Traffic**: Free accounts are allocated up to 5,000 requests per month.
- **Audio Processing**: Free accounts include a limit of 1,000 minutes of audio processing (such as transcoding and waveform generation) to help manage operational costs.
- **Audio Quality**: To optimize streaming, audio for free accounts is transcoded to 64k Opus. This format provides reasonable quality, roughly comparable to 128k MP3.
- **Sharing & Embedding**: Sharing URLs for free accounts expire after **3 days** to manage server resources and security.

### 🗂️ Data Management for Free Accounts

To maintain sustainable service costs and optimal performance for all users, we implement the following data management policies for free accounts:

- **Inactive Track Removal**: Tracks on free accounts that receive no activity (plays, shares, or edits) for **3 months or more** may be automatically deleted without prior notice. We recommend keeping your tracks active through regular engagement.
- **Inactive Account Cleanup**: User accounts that remain completely inactive (no login or activity) for **6 months or more** may be subject to removal to free up system resources.
- **Pre-deletion Notifications**: While we aim to send warning emails before automatic deletions, we cannot guarantee delivery. **Consistent activity is the best way to ensure your content remains available.**

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: [Become a sponsor](/docs/general/sponsor-this-project/) to enjoy **permanent data retention** and significantly higher storage limits!
