## Keeping Mix That Sustainable

To offer Mix That as a free service, we need to manage our operational costs, particularly for storage and network traffic. We've implemented some fair usage limits to ensure everyone can enjoy the platform.

## Free Account Limits

Here's what you can expect with a free Mix That account:

- Storage: You can store up to 2GB of audio or a maximum of 25 tracks, whichever limit is reached first.
- Network Traffic: Free accounts are allocated up to 5,000 requests per month.
- Audio Quality: To optimize streaming, audio for free accounts is transcoded to 64k Opus. This format provides excellent quality, roughly comparable to 128k MP3.
- Inactive Track Removal: To efficiently manage our storage resources, tracks on free accounts that receive no activity for three months or more may be deleted without warning. We'll do our best to notify you, but consistent activity is key to keeping your tracks live.

## Elevate Your Experience with Sponsorship

Need more out of Mix That? Consider becoming a sponsor! Your support directly helps us grow the platform and unlocks significant benefits:

- API Access: Gain full access to the Mix That API for advanced integrations and workflows.
- Download Quality Audio: Store and download your mixes in high-quality, uncompressed formats.
- Increased Storage: Enjoy significantly higher storage limits tailored to your needs.
- Custom Audio Quality: Discuss your specific audio quality requirements with us for tailored solutions.
- Becoming a sponsor is the best way to supercharge your Mix That experience and contribute to the platform's future.

## Fair Use Policy

We're committed to providing a stable and reliable service for all our users. Please note that we actively monitor accounts to prevent attempts to circumvent these limits. Any accounts found to be engaging in suspicious activity or abusing the service may be disabled or blocked without prior notice.
