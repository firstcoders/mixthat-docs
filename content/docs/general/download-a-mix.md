Downloading High-Quality Mixes

Mix That allows you to download high-quality mixes of your tracks, provided that high-quality audio is available for all stems in the player.

:warning: Downloading a mix requires storing high-quality audio, which uses additional storage resources. To keep Mix That sustainable, this feature is available to [sponsors](/docs/other/sponsor-this-project/).

## How to Download a Mix

1. **Optional:** Select the region of the track you want to download using the player interface. If no region is selected, the entire track will be downloaded.
2. Click the `download mix` button.
3. A high-quality mix will be created for the selected region (or entire track if no region is selected) and your download will begin automatically.

**Note:** If you have selected a specific region in the player, only that selected portion of the track will be included in the downloaded mix. This allows you to download just the parts of your track that you need.

If you have any questions or need help with downloading, please contact our support team.
