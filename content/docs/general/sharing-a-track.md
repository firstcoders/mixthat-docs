Sharing your music with others is easy in Mix That!

To share a track, simply click the share icon:

## Account Features

- You can change a track's public/private status at any time in the track settings
- Remember, while the track is "public", sharing a link means anyone with the URL can access your track
- [Upgrade your plan](/docs/other/sponsor-this-project/) to unlock extended sharing options

## Extended Share Options

For [sponsors](/docs/other/sponsor-this-project/), Mix That offers advanced sharing capabilities that provide greater control and functionality:

### Extended Share Expiry

By default, share links expire after 3 days for security purposes. However, sponsors have additional options:

- **Extended expiry periods**: Choose longer expiration times for your share links
- **Indefinite sharing**: Set links to never expire for permanent sharing needs
- **Flexible control**: Change expiry settings based on your specific sharing requirements

### Allow Creation of Mix to Users

When source audio is stored for all stems in your track (available to sponsors), you can enable recipients to:

- **Generate custom mixes**: Share link users can create their own mix versions
- **Interactive experience**: Recipients can adjust stem levels and create personalized versions
- **Enhanced collaboration**: Perfect for sharing works-in-progress with collaborators

### Allow Downloading of Source Audio

This option allows recipients of the share link to:

- **Download individual stems**: Access source audio for any stem that has it available
- **Professional collaboration**: Share high-quality audio files with other producers or musicians
- **Remix capabilities**: Enable others to use your stems in their own projects

### Creating Advanced Shares

After selecting your desired options:

1. Click **"Create Share"** to generate your customized share link
2. **Copy the share link**: Direct URL that can be shared via email, messaging, or social media
3. **Copy the embed code**: HTML code for embedding the player directly in websites

### Embed Code Usage

The embed code can be pasted into:

- **Your website**: Add the Mix That player directly to your site
- **Content management systems**: WordPress, Squarespace, and other CMS platforms
- **Blog posts and articles**: Embed interactive audio content

**Important for embeds**: For persistent embeds that remain functional long-term, ensure the expiry time is set to indefinite. This prevents the embed code from breaking when the share link expires.
