Our core offering is the [Stem Player](https://www.stemplayer-js.com) â€” a fully customizable web component that seamlessly embeds into any website. It's designed to play back your multitrack and stem audio with unparalleled efficiency, allowing your audience to experience your creations in an interactive and engaging way.

Whether you're looking to create and share interactive stem players for your own multitrack audio online, or you want to embed powerful stem players directly into your website, Mix That provides the tools you need.

## Why Choose Mix That?

Mix That stands out by offering a highly efficient and performant way to stream multitrack and stem audio. This is made possible through our advanced HTTP-streaming audio protocol. Unlike traditional methods, our approach allows the player to stream and decode only a brief section of the track into the browser's memory at any given time.

This innovative technology means you can confidently play tracks with more stems and much longer durations without compromising performance. We handle all the complex technicalities behind the scenes, including audio transcoding and secure, high-speed Content Delivery Network (CDN) streaming, all fully configured and optimized for you. With Mix That, you can focus on your music, not the technical hurdles.
