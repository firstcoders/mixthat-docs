## Keeping Mix That Sustainable

To offer Mix That as a free service, we need to manage our operational costs, particularly for storage and network traffic. We've implemented some fair usage limits to ensure everyone can enjoy the platform.\*\*\*\*

### Data Management for Free Accounts

To maintain sustainable service costs and optimal performance for all users, we implement the following data management policies for free accounts:

- **Inactive Track Removal**: Tracks on free accounts that receive no activity (plays, shares, or edits) for **3 months or more** may be automatically deleted without prior notice. We recommend keeping your tracks active through regular engagement.
- **Inactive Account Cleanup**: User accounts that remain completely inactive (no login or activity) for **6 months or more** may be subject to removal to free up system resources.
- **Pre-deletion Notifications**: While we aim to send warning emails before automatic deletions, we cannot guarantee delivery. **Consistent activity is the best way to ensure your content remains available.**

> ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip**: [Become a sponsor](/docs/other/sponsor-this-project/) to enjoy **permanent data retention** and significantly higher storage limits!

### Cost Control Through Sponsorship

By becoming a sponsor, you're not just getting premium featuresâ€”you're helping us maintain sustainable operations. Sponsorship allows us to:

- Keep free accounts available for new users and hobbyists
- Invest in better infrastructure and features
- Maintain predictable operational costs through dedicated supporter contributions

**Ready to supercharge your Mix That experience?** [Learn more about sponsorship benefits and pricing](/docs/other/sponsor-this-project/) or contact us for custom solutions tailored to your needs.

## Fair Use Policy

We're committed to providing a stable and reliable service for all our users. Please note that we actively monitor accounts to prevent attempts to circumvent these limits. Any accounts found to be engaging in suspicious activity or abusing the service may be disabled or blocked without prior notice.

Do you have any questions about these limits or how sponsorship can benefit you?
