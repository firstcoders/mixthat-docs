Mixthat Mix That is a service that handles the hosting, transcoding & streaming of audio using fast content-delivery-networks in a format ready to be played by our [_stem-player_](https://www.stemplayer-js.com) â€” a fully customisable web-component that can be embedded in web-sites and is able to play stem & multi-track audio.

You can use it to create Stem Players to play and share multi-track audio online, or you can use it to embed stem-players into your own website.

## Why?

Using our [Stem Player](https://www.stemplayer-js.com) you can stream multi-track / stems in a way that is much more efficient than alternative implementations. The approach that makes this possible is to use a certain audio protocol (http-streaming). This enables the player to stream while decoding only a very brief section of the total track into the browser's memory. This enables playback of tracks with more stems and stems of much longer duration.

Mix That takes care of all the difficult bits, such as audio transcoding and delivering streams using a Content Delivery Network - all fully configured.
