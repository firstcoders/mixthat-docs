# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 6 Jan 2026

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes the type of information that we collect from you ("you/your") through the use of the MixThat application and related services ("Services", "MixThat", "the App") and how that information may be used or disclosed by us and the safeguards we use to protect it. MixThat is an audio and video mixing application that allows users to create, share, and discover mixed content. We have drafted this Privacy Policy to be as clear and concise as possible. Please read it carefully to understand our policies regarding your information and how we will treat it. By using MixThat or providing content through the App, you agree to the collection, use and disclosure of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time and your continued use of MixThat is deemed to be acceptance of such changes, so please check periodically for updates. You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance. It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us. If you have any comments on this Privacy Policy, please email them to privacy@firstcoders.co.uk.

We review our data retention obligations to ensure we are not retaining data for longer than we are legally obliged to.
